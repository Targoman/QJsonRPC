Here is a brief guide on how to build Targoman SMTCore, tools and associated
libraries.

1 - Unpack:  This should give a top-level directory with the subdirectories
    listed in README, as well as a few documentation files and a buildAndTest
    script. For an overview of Targoman, see the documentation in Docs folder.

2 - Requirements:
    * Linux x86 64bit machine
    * Following Qt development packages version 5.4 or above:
            - Qt5Core
            - Qt5Concurrent
            - Qt5Network
            - Qt5WebSocket
            - Qt5JSON
            - Qt5Sql-mysql
            - Qt5Test
            - Qt5Xml
    * g++: v4.8.3 or above
    * cmake: v3.0 or bove
    * GNU make: v4.0 or above
    * libxml2 development v2.9 
3 - run buildAndTest.sh script on Targoman top level directory to build 
    everything. Options are:
    * full: cleans up and rebuilds everything in Debug mode
    * full release: cleans up and rebuilds everything in Release mode
    * NO_OPTION: builds changes made to code

4 - All Targoman outputs will be stored in 'out' subdirectories will be:
    * bin:      Targoman applications and tools. 
    * build:    Build process object files
    * conf:     Dictionaries and static configurations off all apps and tools
    * include:  APIs and essential include files for further development
    * lib:      Targoman libraries 
    * test:     Test binaries
    * unitTest  UnitTest binaries
